            <h3>Programming & Arduino</h3>
            <p>I started learning to code during my 1st year of college in 2018 and the first language that I learned was C. Later on during 
                my 2nd year of college I started to learn more about circuits and circuit design. This was the time when I got familiarized 
                with Arduino and got my first Arduino UNO by the end of the year. I started building some basic projects using Arduino UNO and 
                I used C programming language to programme all of my Arduino projects, this is how I started my programming journey. Today I 
                can easily build any kind of project using the Arduino microcontroller board and its family, as well as I have a decent proficiency in C language.</p>

            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p> After graduating in the year 2022, I decided to pivot from becoming a Hardware Engineer to a Software Developer and thus started to 
                acquire knowledge about web development, as it is the fastest and most engaging way to become a developer. I have a very peripheral 
                knowledge and expertise in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am still learning Javascript frameworks and soon going to advance into the MERN stack.</p>
