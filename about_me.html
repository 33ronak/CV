    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr size="1" ; noshade>
    <p>I'm a 24 years old Electronics Engineering graduate looking for some challenging industrial opportunity in the field of 
        Web Development. I'm a very curious and enthusiastic person, I love learning new technologies and building relevant applications using them. I also 
        enjoy solving different kinds of problems and finding their solutions. As a kid, I was always curious about how gadgets and electrical things around 
        me used to work. I assembled my first PC in class 5 with a help of a computer technician and used it to enjoy surfing the web as a favourite pastime 
        and play FIFA 10; I slowly developed a passion for the internet as a whole and wanted to learn more about it as well as the inner working of a personal 
        computer. I slowly understood the impact of Apple II and Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs in the field of personal computing. With the support of my parents 
        and teachers, I soon realized about engineering and aspired to become an electrical engineer by class 11 just like Wozniak. But I was not a studious 
        person with good grades that would allow me to pursue engineering in top tier colleges of this country, but anyways with the support of my parents, I 
        went to fulfil my dream from a tier 3 college. Now I am looking to begin my career as a Developer as I was able to connect with this field and wanted 
        to pursue it as a lifelong career.
